# Introduction to Data Science Study Guide

UI/UX and user-centered design:
  Main idea: |
    User should be thinking about the information, not the design. User
    perceives well-functioning visualization as reflection of quality data and
    organized company.

  Bridging two gulfs of execution and evaluation (Don Norman):
    In execution, the user:
      - plans goal
      - specifies goal in more detail
      - performs action on UI intending to reach goal
      
    In evaluation, the user:
      - perceives results
      - interprets results
      - compares results with intended goal

  Capturing user preferences:
    Data collection and analysis:
      Via:
        - User surveys
        - Observing users
        - Click and navigation data
        
      Kansei engineering:
        Kansei: |
          "aims at the development or improvement of products and services by
          translating the customer's psychological feelings and needs into the
          domain of product design (ie parameters)"
          
        Consumer affective responses: |
          CARs are psychological feelings resulting from interaction with
          product features
          
        Product form features: PFFs (or PFs?) are product's design
  
    Prototyping:
      - UML and wireframing for UI flow (software eg Visio, Balsamiq)
      - Spiral lifecycle incrementally involves users in design improvement
  
  Shneiderman's eight rules:
    1 Consistency: |
      in sequences of actions, identical terminology, and consistent commands.
  
    2 Shortcuts: |
      enable frequent users to reduce the number of interactions. eg
      abbreviations, function keys, hidden commands, and macro facilities.
    
    3 Informative feedback: |
      for every user action. Frequent and minor actions -> response minor;
      infrequent and major actions -> response major.
    
    4 Closure: |
      created by creating beginning, middle, and end. Gives users satisfaction
      of accomplishment.
    
    5 Simple error handling: |
      so user cannot make serious error. System should detect error and offer
      simple handling.
    
    6 Easy reversal of actions: |
      relieves anxiety, since user knows errors can be undone.
    
    7 Internal locus of control: |
      supported so user senses they are in charge of system Users are initiators
      of actions rather than responders.
    
    8 Short-term memory load: |
      reduced by designing simple design, consolidating multiple pages, reducing
      window motion, etc.
  
  Challenges:
    Uncertainty:
      - In data
      In requirements: |
        User may hide important facts intentionally or unintentionally due to
        politics, financials, privacy, regulations, etc.
      
    Adoption: |
      Communication. Get product champions and early adopters supporting
      dashboard to gain support across organization.
    
    Expectations: |
      Set and be clear about what dashboard will do, how it will function, and
      when it will be delivered. Constraints due to time, budget.
