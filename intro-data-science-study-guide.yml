# Intro to Data Science Study Guide

UI/UX and user-centered design:
  Main point: |
    User should be thinking about the information, not the design. User perceives
    well-functioning visualization as reflection of quality data and organized
    company.

  Bridging two gulfs of execution and evaluation (Don Norman):
    In execution, the user:
      - plans goal
      - specifies goal in more detail
      - performs action on UI intending to reach goal
    In evaluation, the user:
      - perceives results
      - interprets results
      - compares results with intended goal

  Capturing user preferences:
    Data collection and analysis:
      Via:
        - User surveys
        - Observing users
        - Click and navigation data
      Kansei engineering:
        Kansei: |
          "aims at the development or improvement of products and services by
          translating the customer's psychological feelings and needs into the
          domain of product design (i.e. parameters)"
        Consumer affective responses: |
          CARs are psychological feelings resulting from interaction with product
          features
        Product form features: PFFs (or PFs?) are product's design
  
    Prototyping:
      - UML and wireframing for UI flow (software: Visio, Balsamiq)
      - Spiral lifecycle incrementally involves users in design improvement
